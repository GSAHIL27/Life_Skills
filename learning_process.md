# Learning Process — Rephrased Answers

## Question 1  
**What is the Feynman Technique?**  
A method where you learn something and then explain it in very simple words as if you’re teaching someone else.

## Question 2  
**Most interesting ideas from the video:**  
- The idea that the brain works in two complementary modes — an “intense focus” mode and a “relaxed/diffuse” mode — and both are important for learning. It’s a useful reminder that constant concentration isn’t always the fastest or most effective way; often the “relaxed mind” gives space for insights to emerge. 
-The emphasis on breaking large topics into smaller, manageable chunks — which matches so well with your study plans. Tackling smaller pieces makes learning less overwhelming and more sustainable. 
-The encouragement that learning slowly — giving yourself time — is perfectly valid. Not everyone learns at the same speed, and that doesn’t reflect lack of ability. For someone like you juggling studies, internship, health recovery, and side-projects, this was especially comforting and realistic.

## Question 3  
**Active vs. Diffused Thinking:**  
- Active mode: when you’re fully focused and working directly on a problem.  
- Diffused mode: when you’re relaxed, not forcing focus, and ideas form naturally in the background.

## Question 4  
**Steps to follow when starting a new topic:**  
- Break the topic into smaller, manageable parts.  
- Learn just enough so you can identify and correct your own mistakes.  
- Eliminate distractions.  
- Practice consistently for at least 20 hours.

## Question 5
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**
- Break topics into smaller, simpler parts so they are easier to understand.
- Use the Feynman Technique by explaining ideas in simple words to check my understanding.
- Balance focused study (active mode) with relaxation time (diffused mode) to let ideas form naturally.
- Remove distractions so I can stay fully attentive while learning.
- Practice consistently for at least 20 hours instead of expecting instant results.
- Be patient with myself and remember that slow learning often leads to deeper understanding.
- Stay engaged by showing interest and asking questions whenever something isn’t clear.
- Take notes to stay organized and capture ideas before I forget them.
- Avoid preparing replies or overthinking while learning—focus on the present task.
- Reflect regularly on what I’ve learned so I can spot mistakes early and self-correct.
