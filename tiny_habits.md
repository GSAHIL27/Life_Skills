# Tiny Habits – Assignment Answers

## Question 1- In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me was how small a habit can be and still make a huge difference. The example of flossing just one tooth stood out. It sounded silly at first, but it made sense — when a habit is so small that you can’t fail, you naturally build confidence and momentum. That idea of starting tiny and attaching it to something you already do stayed with me the most.

## Question 2- How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
B = MAP means a behaviour happens when Motivation, Ability and a Prompt come together.
M = Motivation – how much you want to do it.
A = Ability – how easy the habit is.
P = Prompt – the reminder or trigger.

To make new habits easier, you make the action super easy, attach it to a clear prompt, and not depend too much on motivation. Keeping the habit tiny and giving it a simple trigger makes it much easier to repeat every day.

## Question 3- Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Celebrating after doing a habit is important because it makes your brain feel good, and that positive feeling helps the habit stick. When you “shine,” even in a tiny way — like smiling or saying “nice!” — your brain gets a quick reward. That reward creates a positive association with the habit, so you’re more likely to do it again.
The idea is simple: whatever you celebrate becomes a habit. The small celebration makes the habit satisfying, which helps it become automatic faster.

## Question 4- In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me was the concept of getting just 1% better every day. The way the speaker explained how tiny improvements compound over time really stuck with me. It made me realise you don’t need big dramatic changes to see progress — just small, consistent effort. Over months and years, those little steps add up to something huge.

## Question 5- What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book says that real, lasting change comes from changing your identity, not just chasing goals. Every small habit you perform is like a vote for the kind of person you want to become. Instead of saying “I want to read more,” you change your identity to “I am a reader.” When your habits match the person you want to be, the habits become much easier to maintain.

## Question 6- Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The book suggests making habits easier by breaking them into tiny steps. Reduce friction so the good habit becomes the easiest option — keep everything you need ready and visible. You can attach the new habit to something you already do (habit stacking). You can also make the habit more attractive or rewarding so that you feel good after doing it, which encourages you to repeat it.

## Question 7- Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To reduce or eliminate a bad habit, you make it harder by adding friction. Hide the cues, increase the effort required, and remove the triggers completely. The book suggests redesigning your environment so the bad habit becomes inconvenient, like putting your phone in another room or blocking distracting apps. When a habit becomes harder and less rewarding, you naturally do it less.

## Question 8- Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
One habit I want to do more of is reading every day. I can keep my book in a visible place so the cue is obvious. I’ll make it easy by starting with just one page a day. I can make it more satisfying by tracking my streak or giving myself a small reward after reading. Small steps and clear cues make the habit easier to stick to.

## Question 9- Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
A habit I want to reduce is scrolling my phone late at night. I can make the cue invisible by keeping my phone in another room before sleeping. I can make it harder by turning off notifications or adding app locks so it takes extra effort to open distracting apps. And I can make it unsatisfying by reminding myself how tired I feel the next morning. Making the habit difficult and less rewarding naturally reduces it.
