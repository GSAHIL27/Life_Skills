## Question 3- How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?
I know I'm in the excitement quadrant when the activity feels challenging but enjoyable. I feel energized, curious, and motivated to take action. 
Indicators you’re in the Excitement quadrant:

- Your heart rate goes up but in a good way
- You feel proud or curious about what you’re doing
- You think, “This is tough but I can do it”

- You experience “good stress” or adrenaline
- You lose track of time because you’re engaged

## Question 4- Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in your own words in brief. Only the points, no explanation.
- Sleep is a fundamental biological necessity, not a luxury.
- Sleep after learning consolidates memories — it’s like hitting the “save” button so you don’t forget what you learned.
- Sleep before learning primes the brain to absorb new information — without it your ability to take in and retain new knowledge is impaired.
- Lack of sufficient sleep damages many aspects of health: learning/memory performance, immune function, physical health, and even affects genetic/biological markers.
- Chronic sleep deprivation can accelerate aging and negatively impact reproductive health.
- Good sleep of sufficient duration and regularity is essential for overall well-being and long-term health.
- To improve sleep quality: follow a regular sleep schedule, and maintain a conducive sleep environment.

## Question 6- Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points, only the points.
- Exercise stimulates the creation of new brain cells which improves memory and learning capacity.
- A single bout of exercise immediately boosts mood and energy by increasing release of “feel-good” brain chemicals.
- Regular exercise improves focus, attention, and cognitive functions.
- Exercise helps protect the brain from cognitive decline and neuro-degenerative diseases, including reducing risk of dementia.
- Physical activity supports overall brain health: increasing blood flow and oxygen to the brain, reducing inflammation, and improving metabolic / insulin-signalling in neural tissue.

## Question 7- What are some steps you can take to exercise more?
- Schedule short workouts 3–5 times per week rather than aiming only for long sessions.
- Mix aerobic and strength/mobility exercises for balanced benefits.
- Walk or cycle instead of using transport where possible, take stairs instead of elevator, so basically add short movement breaks during sedentary work.
